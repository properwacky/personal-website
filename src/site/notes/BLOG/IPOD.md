## FINDING JOY IN MUSIC AGAIN

```
2025-10-09
```

I caved in and bought an iPod. Honestly, it was from a seller on eBay but nonetheless, I love it. 

I am currently running [Rockbox](https://www.rockbox.org/) with the [SnazzyBones-Min](https://github.com/rsh/rockbox-themes/) theme with a nice green tint applied. The device itself is stacked with a 3000mAh battery and 128gb of iFlash storage.

I don't think of myself as an audiophile, but I can appreciate good-sounding music. I
copied all of my music from CDs and they sound incredible with [[GEAR\|BEYERDYNAMIC DT 770 PRO's.]] Maybe I'm coping, I dunno. 

This ancient little device has taught me to love and appreciate music again, just like I did as a kid. I used to sit in front of my CD player and listen to old JLS albums for hours. Eventually it became Twenty One Pilots, and after losing my interest I got well into the normalised brain rot that is the Spotify playlist algorithm. Don't get me wrong, I have found some incredible bands thanks to that creepy little company (like Future Islands, Mild Orange and The War On Drugs) but I cannot get with it anymore. I would rather buy my music and own it, forever.
