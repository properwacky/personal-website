## PROJECTS

### **~ DEMO AREA FOR GOSFORTH NATURE RESERVE**

Covering a small area near the entrance of Gosforth Nature Reserve, the proposed idea would help inspire the next generation of environmentalists and teach about the inner workings of the natural world. 

With plans to begin development throughout Winter 2025 for it to be completed by for the change of season in 2026. 
### **~ BADGER WALKS**

I was approached by [NSHN](https://www.nhsn.org.uk/) to plan and lead walks around the nature reserve in hopes of finding traces and sightings of badgers, with groups limited to five paying members. The session would start at 19:30, with a short presentation on badger ecology and threats facing the UK's last land predator. The walk would began at around 19:45, with the group following the leader around a path known to be the edge of the badger's territory (marked with communal latrines). After more context and explanation, the group would eventually find themselves at the viewing platform. The group would remain here for around an hour, depending on sightings. At around 21:30 (later changed to 21:00 due to light becoming scarce), the group would head back to the meeting point. 

We have plans to begin walks again, around Spring 2026.
