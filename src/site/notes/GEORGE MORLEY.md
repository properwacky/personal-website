# *Hey there, I'm George*

I am working towards a locally connected world through addiction cessation, education, and rewilding. I am currently studying full-time, and volunteering away the remainder.

### PROJECTS

#### DEMO AREA FOR GOSFORTH NATURE RESERVE (2025 - )

Covering a small area near the entrance of Gosforth Nature Reserve, the proposed idea would help inspire the next generation of environmentalists and teach about the inner workings of the natural world. 

With plans to begin development throughout Winter 2025 for it to be completed by for the change of season in 2026. You can follow progress of the area on my Substack.
#### BADGER WALKS (2025 - )

Sounds funny, and I promise we didn't dress up as badger's and walk the streets. Rather, I ran walks at a local nature reserve to find the elusive badger. It was very successful, with hopes of bringing it back in 2026.
#### PEACEFUL FOUNDATION (2024 - )

I volunteer some of my time to help with a wonderful charity. Made by someone I am lucky enough to call a friend, [Peaceful](https://peacefulfoundation.org/) is a charity that purely focuses on building local community through solving addiction and other widespread anomalies. The methods *actually* work, with the most popular being *The Easy Peasy Way To Quit Porn* which is adapted from Allen Carr's *Easy Way*.
