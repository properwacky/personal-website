# Hey there, I'm George ðŸŒ´

I am working to create a connected world through global and local change.

## What am I working on?

I am currently using my time to learn and volunteer. I love being out in nature, so my main priority is growing a career in conservation.

I'm currently working with: [peaceful](https://peacefulfoundation.org/) ~ [endCE](https://www.endce.org/) ~ [NHSN](https://www.nhsn.org.uk/)
